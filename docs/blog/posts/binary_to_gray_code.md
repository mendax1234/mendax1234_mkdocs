## What is Gray code?
[**The definition of Gray Code on Wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code)
> The reflected binary code (RBC), also known as reflected binary (RB) or Gray code after Frank Gray, is an ordering of the binary numeral system such that two successive values differ in only one bit (binary digit).
