In Python, Dictionaries are used to store data value in key:value pairs. Each key in the Dictionary may have zero or one or multiple values.</p> <p>How to assign multiple values to one key?</p> <p>Let's say that in Python, we usually use <code>lists</code> or <code>tuples</code> to store a bunch of values. Similarly, we still can use these two data structures to store different values of a key element in the Dictionary. However, one thing you should notice is that <code>tuple</code> is immutable while <code>list</code> is mutable.</p> <p>Below is the demo:</p> Python <pre><code># List method\nmyDict = {\"userName\":[\"Jack\",\"Tom\",\"James\",\"Andy\"]} # You can add anything to the \"userName\"\n# Tuple method\nmyDict = {\"userName\":(\"Jack\",\"Tom\",\"James\",\"Andy\")} # You can't add something or delete something to \"userName\" since tuple is immutable\n</code></pre> <p>How to add values to one key in Dictionary?</p> <p>Firstly, you need to make sure that you have used the <code>list</code> method. Secondly, all you need to do is just using the methods owned by <code>list</code> in Python.
